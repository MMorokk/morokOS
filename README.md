It isn't really a distro, but it's an installation script that fully installs my dotfiles, dependencies and programs. It is NOT SAFE FOR WORK becouse it's fully relying on git versions of programs and aur. Something WILL BREAK, so be sure to make backups of your files and stuff. Or just learn how to [fix arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).
